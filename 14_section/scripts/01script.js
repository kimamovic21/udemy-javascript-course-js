// 01. What is Object-Oriented Programming ?

'use strict';

/* 
The 4 fundamental OOP principles:

1. Abstraction - ignoring or hiding details that don't matter
2. Encapsulation - keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class
3. Inheritance - making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class
4. Polymorphism - a child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class
