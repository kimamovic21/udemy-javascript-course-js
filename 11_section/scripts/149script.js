/*
Map method

-Map method creates a brand new array based on original array
-Map method takes an array, loops over that array, and in each iteration it applies a callback function 
 that we specify on our code to the current array element
-Map method retursn a new array containing the results of applying an operation on all original array elements


Filter method

-FIlter method is used to filter for elements in the original array which satisfy a certain condition
-All the elements that pass the test that we specified will make it into a new filtered array
-Elements for which the conditon is true will be included in a new array that the filter method returns
-All other elements will get filtered out, so they will not be included in the new array
-Filter method returns a new array containing the array elements that passed a specified test condition


Reduce method

-Reduce method we use to boil down all the elements of the original array into one single value
