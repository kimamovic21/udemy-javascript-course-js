// 92. The JavaScript Engine and Runtime

'use strict';

// JS Engine is a program that executes javascript code

// Example: V8 Engine
// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWhMKalEicY
// Javascript engine contains Call Stack and Heap
// Call Stack - place where our code is executed
// Heap - unstructured memory pool which stores all the objects that our application needs


// Compilation vs. Interpretation

// Compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer
// Interpretation: Interpreter runs through the source code an executes it line by line
// Just-in-time (JIT) compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately


// Modern Just-in-time compilation of javascript


// Javascript Runtime
