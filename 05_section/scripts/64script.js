// Coding Challenge #2 With AI

/*
Let's say you're building a time tracking application for freelancers. At some point in building this app, 
you need a function that receives daily work hours for a certain week, and returns:

1. Total hours worked
2. Average daily hours
3. The day with the most hours worked
4. Number of days worked
5. Whether the week was full-time (worked 35 hours or more)

TEST DATA: [7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0]

function analyzeWorkWeek(dailyHours) {
  const daysOfWeek = [
    'Monday',
    'Tuesday',
    'Wednesday',
    'Thursday',
    'Friday',
    'Saturday',
    'Sunday',
  ];

  // Validate that the input array has exactly 7 elements
  if (!Array.isArray(dailyHours) || dailyHours.length !== 7) {
    throw new Error('Input must be an array of exactly 7 daily work hours.');
  };

  // Calculate total hours worked
  const totalHours = dailyHours.reduce((sum, hours) => sum + hours, 0);

  // Calculate average daily hours, rounded to one decimal place
  const averageHours = Math.round((totalHours / dailyHours.length) * 10) / 10;

  // Find the day with the most hours worked
  const maxHours = Math.max(...dailyHours);
  const maxDayIndex = dailyHours.indexOf(maxHours);
  const maxDay = daysOfWeek[maxDayIndex]; // Convert index to day name

  // Count the number of days worked
  const daysWorked = dailyHours.filter(hours => hours > 0).length;

  // Check if the week was full-time (35 hours or more)
  const isFullTime = totalHours >= 35;

  // Return the result object
  return {
    totalHours,
    averageHours,
    maxDay, // The name of the day with the most hours
    daysWorked,
    isFullTime,
