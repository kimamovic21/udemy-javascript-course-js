// 247. IMPORTANT: API URL Change

'use strict';

/*
ðŸš¨ The base URL of the API used throughout this section has changed

It's not a big deal, it's really just one small change. Instead of:

https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/

It's now:

https://restcountries.com/v2/

So whenever we use the Countries API in this section, please just change 
the URL you see in the videos to this new one.
